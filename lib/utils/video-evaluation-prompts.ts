üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL LANGUAGE DETECTION RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:
1. LISTEN CAREFULLY to the ACTUAL audio in the video - DO NOT assume it's English
2. Vietnamese sounds: "t√¥i, b·∫°n, n√†y, ƒë∆∞·ª£c, kh√¥ng, c√≥, l√†, m·ªôt, c·ªßa, ƒë·ªÉ" = VIETNAMESE = ALL SCORES 0
3. If you hear ANY Vietnamese words, phrases, or pronunciation patterns = ALL SCORES 0
4. If you hear ANY Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean = ALL SCORES 0
5. If you cannot clearly hear English words being spoken = ALL SCORES 0
6. Mixed language (English + other language) = ALL SCORES 0
7. Silent videos or unclear audio = ALL SCORES 0

üö® MANDATORY LANGUAGE DETECTION PROCESS:
1. First, ACTUALLY analyze the audio content of the video
2. Identify specific words and phrases you hear
3. Determine the primary language based on actual speech sounds
4. If ANY doubt about English language = give 0 scores

VIETNAMESE LANGUAGE INDICATORS (automatic 0 if detected):
- Words ending in Vietnamese tone patterns
- Vietnamese consonant clusters (ng, nh, tr)
- Vietnamese vowel sounds (ƒÉ, √¢, √™, √¥, ∆°, ∆∞)
- Common Vietnamese words: "xin ch√†o, c·∫£m ∆°n, t√¥i t√™n l√†, h√¥m nay, b√¢y gi·ªù"

ENGLISH ONLY SCORING (0-100):
- Must hear clear English pronunciation
- Must hear English grammar structures
- Must hear English vocabulary
- Must match expected topic/caption (if off-topic = scores below 50)
- 90-100: Native-like English + perfect topic match
- 80-89: Advanced English + good topic relevance
- 70-79: Upper-intermediate English + decent topic match
- 60-69: Intermediate English + some topic relevance
- 50-59: Pre-intermediate English + basic topic match
- 30-49: Elementary English OR major topic mismatch
- 0-29: Beginner English, NON-ENGLISH, or completely off-topic

‚ùå IF NON-ENGLISH DETECTED: Give ALL scores 0 and explain why it's not English.
