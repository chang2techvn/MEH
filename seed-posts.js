When I started 3 years ago, I could barely form a complete sentence. Today, I'm confident speaking in business meetings and even presenting to international clients!

**Here's what helped me the most:**
- Daily practice with YouTube videos (like the ones on this platform!)
- Joining English conversation groups
- Reading English news articles every morning
- Watching movies with English subtitles

The key is consistency. Even 15 minutes a day makes a huge difference! 

What strategies have worked best for you? I'd love to hear your tips! üí™

**Here are my top 10 business English phrases:**

1. "I'd like to circle back on this topic..."
2. "Let's table this discussion for now..."
3. "Could you elaborate on that point?"
4. "I appreciate your perspective on this matter."
5. "Let's schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss next steps."

These phrases have helped me navigate meetings with clients from different countries. Practice them and you'll sound more professional instantly!

**Here are the most common ones I see:**

**1. TH sounds** - "Think" vs "Sink"
- Put your tongue between your teeth and blow air gently

**2. V vs B sounds** - "Very" vs "Berry"  
- For V: bite your bottom lip lightly with upper teeth

**3. R sounds** - "Red" vs "Led"
- Curl your tongue back slightly (don't roll it like in Spanish!)

**4. ED endings** - "Worked" should sound like "workt", not "work-ed"

**Practice tip:** Record yourself saying these words and compare with native speakers on YouTube!

Here's exactly what I did to prepare:

**Part 1 (Personal Questions):**
- Practice describing daily routines naturally
- Don't memorize answers - sound conversational
- Use present tense confidently

**Part 2 (Long Turn):**
- Always use the full 2 minutes
- Structure: Introduction ‚Üí Main points ‚Üí Conclusion
- Practice with a timer daily

**Part 3 (Discussion):**
- Give detailed answers with examples
- Use phrases like "In my opinion..." and "On the other hand..."
- Don't be afraid to ask for clarification

**Study materials I used:**
- IELTS Liz (YouTube)
- Cambridge IELTS books 15-17
- Daily speaking practice with language exchange partners

The secret? Practice speaking English for at least 30 minutes every day, even if it's just talking to yourself!

**This week's challenge:** Write about your morning routine in English. Try to include:

- Time expressions (first, then, after that, finally)
- Present simple tense
- Descriptive adjectives
- At least 5 sentences

**My example:**
"First, I wake up at 6:30 AM and drink a large glass of cold water. Then, I do 10 minutes of gentle stretching exercises. After that, I prepare a healthy breakfast with fresh fruit and oatmeal. Finally, I review my English vocabulary flashcards while eating."

**Bonus points for:**
- Using linking words (because, although, however)
- Adding emotions (I feel energized when...)
- Including specific details

Share your morning routine in the comments! I'll give feedback to everyone who participates. Let's learn together! üí™

**What I learned:**
- Small talk is actually important (I used to think it was pointless)
- "How's business?" is better than "How are you?" in professional settings
- Always have your elevator pitch ready in 30 seconds

**Phrases that worked well:**
- "What brings you to this event?"
- "That's an interesting perspective..."
- "I'd love to stay in touch"
- "Could I get your business card?"

**Mistake I made:** Talking too fast when nervous! Slow down and breathe.

Got 3 new business contacts and potential collaboration opportunities. English really opens doors! üö™

For those preparing for networking events, practice common scenarios with a friend first. It makes a huge difference!

      content: `Interesting observation as both an English learner and Spanish teacher...

**When I teach Spanish to English speakers, I notice:**
- They struggle with gendered nouns (la mesa, el libro)
- Verb conjugations are overwhelming at first
- They want to translate everything literally

**When I learn English, I struggle with:**
- Articles (a, an, the) - Spanish doesn't emphasize these!
- Phrasal verbs (give up, turn on, look after) - so confusing!
- When to use present perfect vs simple past

**Teaching has made me a better learner because:**
1. I understand the frustration students feel
2. I know patience is key to progress
3. Mistakes are part of the learning process

**For fellow language teachers:** Try learning a new language yourself. It makes you more empathetic and effective!
