🔍 REACT FRONTEND DEBUGGING
===========================

Since backend is working, the issue is in React components.

📱 BROWSER CONSOLE TESTS FOR REACT:
===================================

1. Check if chat context is properly loaded:
   window.chatContext || 'Chat context not found'

2. Check React component state:
   // In DevTools React tab, select chat component and run:
   $r.state || $r.props

3. Check if conversations are in React state:
   // If using React DevTools, look for:
   // - conversations array
   // - messages array
   // - loading states

4. Test chat context functions:
   // If chat context is available globally:
   window.sendMessage && window.sendMessage('test')

📋 COMMON REACT ISSUES:
======================
1. **State not updating**: Messages sent but React state not updated
2. **Subscription not connected**: Realtime events not triggering React re-renders
3. **Component not re-rendering**: State changes but UI doesn't update
4. **Memory leaks**: Old subscriptions not cleaned up
5. **Race conditions**: Multiple API calls interfering

🔧 DEBUGGING STEPS:
==================

1. **Open React DevTools**
   - Install React Developer Tools extension
   - Look for ChatContext or chat-related components
   - Check component state and props

2. **Check Network Tab**
   - See if API calls are being made
   - Look for failed requests
   - Check WebSocket connections for realtime

3. **Check Console Errors**
   - Look for React warnings
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Watch for Supabase errors

4. **Add Debug Logs**
   - Add console.log in chat context
   - Log when messages are sent
   - Log when realtime events are received

💡 QUICK FIXES TO TRY:
=====================

1. **Force Re-render**:
   // In browser console, if component is selected in React DevTools:
   $r.forceUpdate && $r.forceUpdate()

2. **Clear Component State**:
   // Reset chat state and reload
   localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear(); location.reload();

3. **Check Subscription Status**:
   // Look for Supabase channel status
   supabase.getChannels().forEach(ch => console.log(ch.state))

🚨 LIKELY CAUSES:
================
Based on symptoms (messages appear after refresh but disappear):

1. **Optimistic UI Issue**: 
   - Messages added to local state immediately
   - But removed when refetch happens due to RLS policy mismatch

2. **Subscription Filter Issue**:
   - Realtime working but filtered incorrectly
   - Not matching current user's view

3. **State Management Bug**:
   - Race condition between send and fetch
   - State not properly synchronized

🎯 NEXT STEPS:
=============
1. Check React DevTools for chat component state
2. Look at Network tab during message sending
3. Check console for any errors
4. Try the browser console tests above

🔧 SPECIFIC CODE TO ADD TO CHAT CONTEXT:
========================================

Add these debug logs to your chat context to see what's happening:

// In sendMessage function:
console.log('🚀 Sending message:', { content, conversationId });

// In realtime subscription handler:
console.log('📨 Realtime message received:', payload);

// In fetchConversations/fetchMessages:
console.log('📋 Fetched conversations:', conversations);
console.log('📝 Fetched messages:', messages);

// In useEffect cleanup:
console.log('🧹 Cleaning up subscriptions');
`);
